# Anti-996 License

Version 1.0, March 2019

Copyright (C) 2019 Jian Weihao

## PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to prevent the adoption of 996 work schedules (9:00-21:00, 6 days per week) in software companies and organizations. We believe that long working hours are harmful to employees' health and well-being, and unsustainable for businesses in the long run.
